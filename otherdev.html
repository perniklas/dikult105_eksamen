                    <h2>Nexus Player</h2>
                    <p>Asus Nexus Player is the followup to the Nexus Q and while the design of its predecessor is brilliant 
                    they changed it to match its greatest rival, the Apple TV. The overall features are expanded on to accomodate 
                    new technologies such as higher resolutions and better remotes. One of the major selling points of the Player 
                    is its price, at aroung 99 dollars it provides a lot of entertainment for non-smart TVs such as an internet browser, 
                    Netflix and other streaming services.</p>
                    <p>A nice feature of the Nexus Player is the game controller that can be bought as an accessory, as 
                    the Player can play Android games with ok-ish graphics. Although the gaming part of the Player can never rival 
                    Playstations and Xboxes it still has its perks.</p>

                    <h2>Nexus Q</h2>
                    <p>Nexus Q was unveiled at Google I/O conference in 2012. Being the only device where Google is the sole manufacturer,
                    their plan for it was to offer customers their own online media services through it. By connecting it to a TV, the user could
                    control it through their Android device as a remote control.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the device never really took off, due to a high price at 300 USD, unclear marketing from Google on what
                    exactly the device would do, and its sub-par capabilities and functionality compared to its competitors. Its intended purpose
                    was reborn in a new and less costly device, the Chromecast.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p> It was quickly discontinued, as Google quietly stopped sales early 2013 and further support with apps, updates and services in 
                    mid-2013. As of today, the Nexus Q doesn't have any official support from Google and is rendered useless.
