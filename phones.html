                    <h2>Nexus 6P</h2>
                    <p>Nexus 6P is an Android smartphone manufactured by Huawei. 
                    It was co-developed with and marketed by Google Inc. as part of its Nexus line 
                    of flagship devices and unveiled on 29 September 2015 along with the Nexus 5X. 
                    It is a successor to the Nexus 6, with a fingerprint reader, a faster CPU, a 
                    slightly smaller display and better cameras, but came with the removal of wireless 
                    charging.</p>
                    <p>Nexus 6P is the premium model of the two 2015 models. It's super specced 
                    with a camera that's better than any earlier Nexus device rivalling even the 
                    cameras of current 2015 flagships. Its Snapdragon 810 v2.1 chipset doesn't overheat 
                    and produces impressive performance, although benchmarks are slightly crippled 
                    by the disk encryption.</p>
                    <p>The Nexus 6P along with the Nexus 5X serve as launch devices for Android 
                    6.0 "Marshmallow", which introduces a refreshed interface, performance improvements, 
                    increased Google Now integration, and other new features. It will be upgradeable to newer versions when available.</p>

                    <h2>Nexus 5X</h2>
                    <p>The Nexus 5X is manufactured by LG and is a direct successor to the 2013 LG Google Nexus 
                    5. It's an affordable alternative to its 6P counterpart and is significantly smaller.
                    It was released together with the Nexus 6P in November 2015.</p>
                    <p>Even though it's meant to be a more affordable handset to the Nexus 6P, it still performs quite well.
                    It has a Snapdragon 808 processor, a slightly weaker processor than its "big brother". The fingerprint sensor 
                    is also present on this phone, enabling users to unlock their phones by tapping lightly on the sensor. The camera
                    of the phone is the same as is shipped with the Nexus 6P.</p>
                    <p>This phone ships with the newest Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and will be eligible for new updates when arrived.</p>

                    <h2>Nexus 6</h2>
                    <p>Nexus 6 is manufactured by Motorola and is the Nexus flagship of 2014. The main difference 
                    of this Nexus phone is that it offered a high-end experience never seen before in a Nexus-device.</p>
                    <p>The speakers of the phone were greatly updated to feature stereo front-facing speakers with an audio 
                    quality only bested by the HTC Boomsound setup. The camera was also greatly updated, and compared to the 
                    previous Nexuses the camera is significantly better.</p>
                    <p>The Nexus 6 was shipped with Android 5.0 Lollipop, and can be upgraded to the newest version of Android, 
                    Android 6.0 Marshmallow, as of November 2015.</p>

                    <h2>Nexus 5</h2>
                    <p>Nexus 5, manufactured by LG, was released in November 2013. Like its predecessors it was cheaper 
					than most of the high-end phones on the market which the Nexus 5 outperformed in terms of OS speed 
					and smoothness. The price tag came with a camera and battery size compromise and average battery life 
					lasted around a day of normal use.</p>
					<p>Despite its shortcomings the Nexus 5 was extremely popular due to its 
					perfomance and price-tag combination and when the Nexus 6 was released, people complained so loudly that 
					Google had to release two models in 2015.</p>
					<p>The Nexus 5 was the first device to be shipped with Android 4.4 Kitkat. Later it would receive the update to
					Android 5.0 Lollipop, and later to Android 6.0 Marshmallow.</p>

                    <h2>Nexus 4</h2>
                    <p>Nexus 4 was the first Nexus to be manufactured by LG. It was released in November 2012. Cosmetically, the Nexus 4 
                    brought a new dimension in to the Nexus line; its back was made entirely of glass. While some complained that it would easily crack, 
                    the new change was well received by the customers.</p>
                    <p>The internal parts of the Nexus 4 where quite similar to LG Optimus G, another phone from LG that was released the same year.
                    With an Snapdragon S4 Pro clocking at 1.5GHz and 2GB of RAM  the Nexus 4 was considered to be a high-end phone on par with the 
                    iPhone 5.</p>
                    <p>The software shipped with Nexus 4 at release was a stock version of Android 4.2 Jelly Bean, later in July 2013, it received an 
                    incremental update to Android 4.3, enabling Bluetooth LE, updates to APIs and other improvements.</p>

                    <h2>Galaxy Nexus</h2>
                    <p>Being the provider of some of the greatest hardware any Android phone had seen at the time, the 
                    promising fusion between pure stock Google Android and the hardware brilliance of Samsung delivered 
                    a product that was almost entirely a letdown. The tiny battery combined with a camera that could only 
                    compare to a potato at less-than-stellar light conditions was only justified by the price of the device.</p>
                    <p>Although lacking in several departments, the areas where the Samsung Galaxy Nexus shined was the 
                    blazing fast performance and the brilliantly colorful Super AMOLED screen. The combination of these two 
                    gave the consumer a great overall experience when using the device.</p>
                    <p>Another noteworthy feature is the curved glass that covers the display. Although the display itself is flat, 
                    the curved glass makes it just a tiny bit easier to use with one hand and it really improved on the overall 
                    experience from using the phone.</p>

                    <h2>Nexus S</h2>
                    <p>The Nexus S is a smartphone co-developed by Google and Samsung and manufactured by Samsung 
                    Electronics for release in 2010. It was the first smartphone to use the Android 2.3 "Gingerbread" 
                    operating system, and the first Android device to support Near Field Communication (NFC) in 
                    both hardware and software.</p>
                    <p>This was the fourth time that Google worked with a manufacturer to 
                    produce a phone, the previous being the Google G1, myTouch and the Nexus One, all three by HTC. 
                    Following the Nexus S, the next Android Developer phone was the Galaxy Nexus, released the 
                    following year. </p>

                    <h2>Nexus One</h2>
                    <p>Being the first Nexus phone to be released, this phone is practically useless by 
                    todays standards. It was the first phone to ever have a processor clocked at 1GHz and being manufactured
                    by HTC it also featured a trackball for navigating the UI when touch was out of the picture, like 
                    when wearing gloves.</p>
                    <p>The HTC Google Nexus One was initially intended for developers in order to better 
                    be able to develop applications and tinker with the source code of Android, and to provide a platform for 
					which Google can display their new features and ideas for the OS. To this day the Nexus still serves as 
					both.</p>
